# Coding Rules to Follow

As this is a group project, it is vital that every member follows agreed-upon standards and rules in order to avoid confusion and messy code.
Suggestions and Ideas are always open to implementing or changing as a rule for everyone to follow. We cool fam.

The rules are as follows:
* Documentation - Remember to create documentation of code that you create. You don't want someone pinging you at 2 a.m. asking you how this line of code works 'namsayin?
* Update tasks in Asana regularly for immediate QA
* Packages - Inform the team if you plan on using a package for a specific feature. So they can also use it and not install other packages for the same issue.
